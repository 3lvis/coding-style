# Coding Style

Personal coding style notes and conventions.  
This is a living document where I refine how I like to write and structure code across projects.

## Contents

- [`swift.md`](swift.md) — Swift coding style guide

Other languages or frameworks may be added later.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to capture **my defaults**—what I reach for first when writing code.  
These aren’t hard rules, just guidelines that help me stay consistent and reduce decision fatigue.

## Philosophy

- **Defaults, not dogma:** I prefer a clear baseline, but I’m free to deviate when the situation calls for it.  
- **Consistency:** I’d rather follow my own convention consistently than reinvent it every file.  
- **Simplicity:** Readability and explicitness over cleverness or “magic.”
